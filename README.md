# Deathstare

![alt tag](https://raw.github.com/cloudcity/deathstare/master/Deathstare-robots.png)

Deathstare is a set of tools for load-testing JSON REST APIs.
It provides a promise-alike JSON REST API client, a Rails engine-based
web dashboard, auto-scaling test workers on Heroku, and streaming
results to/from Librato.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/cloudcity/deathstare.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/cloudcity/deathstare)

## Rationale

The reason we created Deathstare is that when we went looking for
custom DDOS tools, we found that they all provided a way to hammer
on a web site with lots of GET requests. However, our intended target
was not a web site, but a web-based API.

To this end, we built a set of tools that allowed us to create detailed,
application-specific performance test suites that can be scaled up to a
very large number of parallel requests.

## Dependencies

* Heroku APP ID
* Librato Account to gather stats

## Getting started

All of the needed set up is done in your own project,
for now we recommend starting with a newly generated Rails app.

Add deathstare to your `Gemfile`:

    gem 'deathstare', git: 'https://github.com/cloudcity/deathstare.git'

    You will need to include the following lines in the Gemfile of your testing application since gemspec cannot
    specify a git resource until Heroku merges our pull request

        # required for app identification to work correctly
        gem 'omniauth-heroku', git: 'https://github.com/cloudcity/omniauth-heroku.git', branch: 'report_uid_and_extra_params', ref: 'c1250900744ba96993f49926f2c4021d735aef8e'

Mount the engine in `config/routes.rb`:

    MyApp::Application.routes.draw do
      mount Deathstare::Engine => '/'
    end

And configure it in an initializer, e.g. `config/initializers/deathstare.rb`:

    Deathstare.configure do
      config.heroku_app_id       = 'Your Heroku App ID'
      config.heroku_oauth_id     = 'Your Heroku OAuth ID'
      config.heroku_oauth_secret = 'Your Heroku OAuth secret'
      config.librato_email       = 'Your Librato email address'
      config.librato_api_token   = 'Your Librato API token'
      config.target_urls << 'https://target.co/api'
      config.target_urls << 'http://stage.target.co/api'
    end

Install deathstare and run the migrations:

    bundle install
    rake deathstare:install:migrations
    rake db:create
    rake db:migrate

It's now possible to start the dashboard:

    rails server

Create a `suite` directory and populate it with subclasses of {Deathstare::Suite}.
These are your test suites! You can run them with rake or in the web dashboard.
To see a list of suites runnable with rake:

    rake -T suite:

To view this documentation locally in your browser, with the dashboard running:

    rake deathstare:yard
    open http://localhost:3000/doc

To scale your tests up using parallel workers, you need to deploy your application to Heroku.
This is left as an exercise for the reader.

# Development

### Running Specs

First, put your database configuration in `spec/dummy/config/database.yml`.

Then run the specs as usual:

    rake spec

You can view the coverage report as well.

    open coverage/index.html

### Updating The Spec Database

In order to update the spec database when you add a migration, you'll need to add the migration
to the dummy app and migrate it.

To avoid errors migrating from the root directory, go into the dummy app and migrate there.

    rake app:deathstare:install:migrations
    cd spec/dummy
    rake db:migrate
